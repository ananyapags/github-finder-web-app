# github-finder-web-app

This was my first deployable web app using React Js, Firebase, and the Google Geocode API. I got to use the Firestore database and storage in Firebase for the first time, and integrate it into a more complex program.

For me this project was a great learning experience not only for Web Development, but also for integration of other code. I had to understand more organized ways to integrate Firebase into my code, and the Google API. This was my first time utlizing many components, and the .env file. This really opened the doors for customization of my projects and better code orgazation.

I would say the most exciting part of this project was debugging the whole process. Every time I added a new feature to the web app and ran into an error, I began to think of ways to make things easier for the user. For example, once a user uploaded listings, you couldn't change it, so I added an edit feature. Or when logging in, I integrated Google OAuth to allow the user to quickly signup for my web app, as that is what I prefer when I go to a new site.
